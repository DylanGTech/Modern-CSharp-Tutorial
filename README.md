Software has played a more crucial role in the lives of all people than ever before. But we see a new development on the horizon: Not only has software itself become a part of our worklife, but not software **development** has also begun to infiltrate the worklives of people who have never considered it for a career. A number of engineers, mathematicians, students, hobbyists, and even economists have all gotten an extra boost to their productivity by less-tedious work being handled automatically by a computer. This book seeks to help you learn the skills needed to write your own code to creatively and quickly solve your own problems, using the ever-evolving C# language and .NET libraries, in the most modern ways possible!

## Preface
Historically, software was as complex and difficult to work with as the machines they ran on. You needed decidicated teams of experts to help you work on your problem in a computer. This cost time and money that the problem-solver might never get back. Now, there are many software applications that need teams of experts and a lot of time to complete, but with programming languages becoming more and more accessible, and computers being cheaper and easier to carry around, there has never been a better time for the ordinary user to pick up a programming language and later begin working on something for themselves, or for those they care about. Many books and tutorials on the topic can provide you with a decent starting point. However, many provide outdated methods for old frameworks, or provide new methods for experienced C# developers. This series explores the most modern-ways to write C# code and use the .NET libraries from a beginner perspective.

### Who this series is for
Although anyone can learn something, there are two primary groups of people whom this series is specialized for: Beginners looking for an entry point into coding, and existing C# developers who want to learn about the latest in C# development techniques. C# serves as a very good entrypoint into the basics of programming, which will be explained later. But it's also common for a hobbyists, or even professionals, to go work on another project in another language, only to come back and see major changes have been made to the ever-evolving ecosystem that is C#. If you are not frequently reading into C#-related news or working on the .NET libraries yourself, you will probably find something of value here.

### Why C#?
The C# languagem and it's partner-in-crime, the .NET libraries, are an often underrated system for software development and programming. The language is simple enough for both beginners to be introduced to the concepts of programming, and it is fast enough for a large project to run efficiently enough for widespread use. The fact that the compiler and the libraries handle a lot of mundane tasks other languages do not, means it is great for creating scripts to process data for an engineer or mathematician. It is the ideal **general purpose** programming language!

### Prerequisites
It would be great for anyone to be able to jump right in, but sadly, not everything is that easy. Here are the big things you need before you get started:
* A working personal computer.
  * [Windows 10+](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) OR [MacOS 11+](https://www.apple.com/macos/)
  * [Visual Studio 2022+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
  * 64-bit (recommended)
* A good understanding of math
  * Arithmatic
  * Algebra
  * Geometry (recommended)
  * Triginometry (recommended)
* Motivation (do you have something you want to make when you learn to code? ðŸ˜‰)
